1801 N 10th Street, Philadelphia PA, 19122
  Brewery and Warehouse Turned Apartment Building 
  I lived in Kardon/Atlantic Apartments for most of my undergraduate degree and although I relish my time in the building, I will never forget its unique structure. The building was litered with massive stone or concreate pillars that were roughly a yard in diameter and were therefore unmistakable. As it turns out this building was both formerly a Brewery and warehouse which would explain its bland design.
