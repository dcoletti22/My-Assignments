# Digital Project Review
### HIST 5152 Reflections Assignment

## About this assignment
By now, you've gained a bit of experience in and understanding of the behind-the-scenes processes of digital history work. Equipped with this knowledge, you now have a chance to critique a project created by someone else. The goal of this review is to provide guidance to potential users and producers of similar digital projects. Your assessment also serves as a contribution to the critical discourse surrounding digital scholarship at large, in an effort to raise the level and quality of work in the field.

### Due date
Due by November 28, 2022.

## Directions
1. Pick one of the ‚Äúfeatured projects‚Äù from this semester, or another digital history/digital humanities project that corresponds to your interests. 
2. Review the project following the guidelines below.
3. Submit your materials.

## Guidelines for the review
Review the project following the guidelines outlined in the Journal of American History and the NCPH Digital History Project Review Guidelines. Your review may take the form of a blog post, a YouTube or video review, a digital exhibit, an oral presentation, etc. or some other type of creative medium (just clear it with me first, please!). The review should be ~500-750 words (if written).

How Virtual Games Offer A Window Into the Real World

Video games are often maligned as a childish thing that does nothing but waste time. However, while some offer less material gains than others, there are a number of practical, and even academic uses. In fact, some of the most popular, widely known series of video games use core content knowledge as a basis for their games. Adam Chapman explains in his book ‚ÄúDigital Games as History‚Äù that many of the most popular games like Call of Duty, Assassin‚Äôs Creed, and Civilization are all decades old series that rely heavily on historical content, narratives, and stories to create their vaunted series. 

Chapman goes even further though to say that what these games offer even beyond the content and narrative is what‚Äôs really valuable. Chapman argues that the ‚Äúinteractivity‚Äù offered by each game allows the user to essentially break the ‚Äúfourth wall‚Äù of history. Instead of just reading or seeing history in the game, the user is making history. However, this obviously differs from game to game, but nevertheless remains true at some level for each.

Personally, I found this book fascinating because it sparked the realization that nearly a decade ago in my own life, my passion for history was also enflamed by the Civilization series. When I was younger myself, the ability to manipulate the world, or a national history yet do so in a game in which still reflected reality was inspiring. I also joke that in such a game, you could both play as Abraham Lincoln and adopt slavery as an economy.

This gets to the next major tenet that Chapman highlights which is the ‚Äúcurated play-space‚Äù. He differentiates that some games address agency differently: In Call of Duty the agency is in their characters movements, whereas in Civilization the agency is in the country's future political, military, and economic decisions. Nevertheless, what both games do is curate the environment and world to make it reflect reality in some sense. So again, shooter games place the user  in the trenches of the Western Front in WW2 whereas in Civilization, the user builds real buildings, units, and works of art.

While this is all good, where Chapman makes the larger point is in his coinage of a concept known as ‚Äúhistorical resonance‚Äù. ‚ÄúHistorical resonance, is the establishment of a link between a game‚Äôs historical representation and the larger historical discourse, as the player understands it,‚Äù explains Chapman (page 36). In other words, the game format - strategy, puzzle, action, shooter - matters less than the game serving as a bridge between the content and the user‚Äôs understanding of the content. The most obvious counter to this concept, at least to me, was that what if the game runs the risk of creating an echo chamber to the user? What if the game only serves to reinforce the user‚Äôs already existing misconceptions? Or rather, what if the narratives being pushed to the user are unappealing? Chapman explains that these outcomes are both fringe and natural. In other words, what makes these games so popular and thus effective, is that ‚Äúhistorical resonance‚Äù is inherently what makes these games effective. Without unlocking this resonance, the games would fall flat and out of the mainstream.

In my opinion, the best example of these notions being put into practice that we observed over the course of semester was actually non-historical in nature. Jason Helms‚Äôs game, ‚ÄúPlay Smarter Not Harder: Developing Your Scholarly Meta‚Äù combines all of the major elements of Chapman's piece but instead of in a historical context, it falls into a more generally academic sense.

Firstly, the game creates agency; in fact, it is literally almost only based in agency, as the user core of the game is the user making various decisions, seeing the outcomes, and subsequently adjusting. Moreover, this all happens in the game‚Äôs designed environment (play-space) where you need to balance both production, feedback and quality, and most importantly, mental health. 

Ye, as Chapman points to, what makes the game effective is that the tents combine to create resonance. Everyone can relate to the issue of balancing time and energy while managing the creation of a paper/project. It bridges the gap between the game scenario and the user‚Äôs understanding of such in real life. In other words, the virtual game managed to offer the user a window into their own understanding of real world scenarios.
