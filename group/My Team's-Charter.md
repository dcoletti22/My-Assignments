# Team Charter
### HIST 5152 Group Project Assignment

## Directions for group assignments
1. Choose one person from your group as the "submitter," who will turn in the group's assignment(s) (You will work collaboratively, but I do not need an individual submission for each member of the group.)
2. Work collaboratively to follow the directions and answer the questions below for each item by its due date. **Note: If you are not familiar with the "push," "pull" and "merge" functions of GitHub (not part of this course), I recommend using another collaborative text editor that you are familiar with to simplify the process of multiple people editing the document at the same time.**
- üëâ The Team Charter is due by 5pm September 19, 2022.üëà
- Part I of the Project Proposal by 5pm September 26, 2022.
- Part II of the Project Proposal is due by 5pm October 3, 2022.
- Part III of the Project Proposal is due by 5pm October 10, 2022.
3. The submitter of the group will make the necessary changes to the assignment document, type "DONE" in the larger box at the bottom of the edited page when it is ready to submit, and commit the changes. Don't forget to commit your changes!! GitHub will not autosave your work!!

## About this assignment
Collaboration is hard! But it's also a vital tool within workplaces and for working on projects with many moving parts. You'll be creating a final project with many moving parts by the end of this semester, and it'll be necessary to collaborate with several of your classmates to complete it. This can serve as a community for you to explore ideas and methods while you work to complete milestones in digital project management that you can bring with you beyond this course.

The thing about group work, is that you have to learn how to do it each time. This can be challenging, sometimes even frustrating, but it's a great learning opportunity that will pay off in a more robust and impactful end product. If you can cultivate a community of trust, respect, mutual understanding, and shared accountability, you'll create something that you can all be very proud of.

Of course, right now, it's possible that you hardly know your group members. That's totally fine, because you're going to get to know them a little better, and set some group goals, boundaries, and expectations before you even start to brainstorm about your final project's form.

## The Charter

### Basics
Assign the following roles to project member(s).
Who will serve as the group's...
- **Project Manager** Drew
- **Recorder** Xiang
- **Timekeeper/Planner** Mikayla
- **Reflector** Ryan

### Goals
Individually, are there technologies/tools you want to learn or methodologies/approaches you want to explore?

**Because the humanities have continued to move towards the digital world, it has become ever more important to master the skill of digital design. Thus, our group wants to focus on technology that allows us to visually reconstruct data/information in engaging, immersive ways like digital mapping, exhibition design, and 3D modeling. Additionally, some members of our group want to become more familiar and practice TEI and may be able to merge their own work into our group project. Ideally, we would like to both understand the current climate in regard to digital design software as well as build foundation applicative skills with some of these software.** 

What are the commonalities in your answers to the above question? Can you develop team goals that will meet each member's preferences?

**Based on our group‚Äôs individual goals, the team shares common interests in mapping and data visualization on a broad level and should aim to develop a project that is general enough that it will be suitable for the range of disciplines that each member represents. Opportunities to gain direct experience practicing with relevant technologies should therefore be the high-level aim of the group project, with the development of more concrete goals following the group‚Äôs approach to the research and use of the tools that we will learn in class (keeping in mind various levels of familiarity with the technology). We will all try our best to develop team goals that will consistently meet each member‚Äôs preferences.**

What are group members‚Äô pet peeves from previous collaborations? How will you avoid these?

**Firstly, it is most important to our team that we clearly, and efficiently communicate with each other so that we are always on the same page. We will be able to do this by regularly checking and responding to emails as well as meeting regularly. This way, we can make sure that everyone is best utilizing their own skill set and there is an efficient and equitable division of work. We will all avoid being late or unprepared so that other team members do not have to do extra, last-minute work.**

What will happen to the project when the semester is over? Will you maintain, update, or add to it?

**It is our hope that we will develop a project that will be broad and rich enough that it can live online as a valuable resource that is regularly updated. However, this will depend on what exactly our group decides will be our final product for our project.**

### Meetings
How often will you meet outside of class? Where will you meet? Do you need a regular meeting time? If you‚Äôll schedule meetings as necessary, what days and times are generally good for people?

**Most people are unavailable on weekends, so we will plan to meet during the work week, except for finalizing assignments during midterms or finals. Our team will meet via Zoom on days later in the week (Thursday or Friday). If needed, we may also meet briefly before class on Monday‚Äôs (between 3 pm and 4 pm) or after class. Since we all have commitments throughout the week we will meet in the afternoon or evening. All meetings will take place in eastern standard time (EST).**

When are people planning to be out of town or especially busy? How can you work around this?

**While various members of our group have commitments to travel at various times throughout the semester, we plan to meet virtually through Zoom and members who need to travel have confirmed that they will still have access to their email, etc.**

How will you prevent meetings from going off-track?

**The group will collaboratively create a loose agenda for each meeting that will keep the discussion focused and conversation moving. We will base our priorities on the deadlines for required elements of the project set by Dr. Heider which should allow us to stay on track throughout the collaboration.**

### Teamwork
Choose three words to describe the spirit in which your group will work together.

**Helpful, supportive, collaborative.**

How will you communicate with each other (e.g., text messaging, email, Discord, Slack, Trello, etc.)?

**We will utilize email and texting for quick and common communication and Google Docs for information and document transfer.**

Where will you store your files so that every group member can access them (e.g., Dropbox, Google Drive, server, Github, etc.)?

**As per our answer above, we will primarily rely on Google Drive for document and data transfer. If we find we need a different program later for this, we can make the necessary adjustments.**

When you work on a document collaboratively, how will you ensure that you don‚Äôt overwrite each other‚Äôs changes?

**Group members will need to insert their name or initials next to their comments/suggestions or use a comment tool to leave notes in the margins. We will also try to keep a list of changes so we can backtrack if necessary, being mindful that no ones comments have been erased and ignored.**

Do all decisions need to be unanimous, or is ‚Äúmajority-rules‚Äù OK?

**Any divisive/dispute decisions will be decided by the majority.**

What other rules can you agree on to help meet our goals and expectations?

**We all agree to have any final revisions done by 4pm on Monday so that the submitter (Andrew) can have time to submit the assignment. We all agree to respect each other‚Äôs schedules.**
