# Project Proposal
### HIST 5152 Group Project Assignment

## About this assignment

## Directions for group assignments
1. Choose one person from your group as the "submitter," who will turn in the group's assignment(s) (You will work collaboratively, but I do not need an individual submission for each member of the group.)
2. Work collaboratively to follow the directions and answer the questions below for each item by its due date. **Note: If you are not familiar with the "push," "pull" and "merge" functions of GitHub (not part of this course), I recommend using another collaborative text editor that you are familiar with to simplify the process of multiple people editing the document at the same time.**

## The Project Proposal
### Part I: The problem + evidence: **To be completed by 5pm September 26, 2022**

_Each group will identify a "problem" - a research question that they will attempt to answer in their project by incorporating their "evidence" - their analyzed source material. They will also take time to consider the group's intended audience, and how that might impact the formulation and presentation of a supported argument._

1. **What is (are) your research question(s)?** _You may define broadly at this early stage._

Are there any breweries, wineries, or distilleries that are owned by people of color? If so, where are they located?

2. **What types of evidence are available to you to address this question?** _Be as broad or specific as you need to at this early stage, e.g. "census records" or "1910 Census Report Vol. 5: Agriculture."_

From breweries to wineries and distilleries, people of color are largely underrepresented in the beer, wine, and alcohol processing industry. Our research aims to first uncover whether there are people of color owned breweries, distilleries, or wineries located in the United States and secondly to map their location. In addition, we will seek to identify trends in branding and design strategies in advertising, interior design, and advertising across our sample set, or showcase the diversity of marketing tactics should there be no visible trends.

https://www.distillerytrail.com/distillery-directory-map/ (has filters for women, black, and native owned distilleries)

3. **What is your audience?** _Who is this project intended for? Be as specific as possible. This may help you know what complexity of language to use, how to handle navigability, and if youâ€™ll need to anticipate any access barriers._

Liquor connoisseurs, POC Travelers, Women Travelers, Millennials, Gen X, and Babyboomers.

### Part II: The method(s): **To be completed by 5pm October 3, 2022**

_Each group will consider which tools and methodologies may help them convey a supported argument using their problem and evidence to the intended audience. They will also inventory their assets and needs at this point._

1. **What tools (specific) or methodologies/approaches (broad) will you use to develop or communicate your argument?**

We will begin by compiling a list of BIPOC owned breweries, distilleries and wineries. We will rely on statistical information about racial breakdown for owners of breweries, distilleries, and wineries. Since we would like to map the locations, we will need to familiarize ourselves with the fundamentals of using mapping software. 

2. **What are your current assets?** _What do you already have? Are there areas of expertise, previous training, special skills, knowledge, or talents that your team has access to? Do you have examples of similar projects that you can consult, emulate, or reverse-engineer? Have you already done some preliminary planning, sketches, prototyping, or experimentation that can inform your process?_

Currently, we have a running list of Black owned breweries, distilleries, and wineries.

Source #2: Distillery Trail
Source #3: One Pint at a Time: Documenting the Black Experience in American Craft Beer
Source #4: Black-owned wine and spirits makers you should know about
Source # 5: List of Black owned distilleries

3. **What are your current needs?** 
 - Data & source material: _What data will you use, and where will you get it? Are there (copyright/cost/accessibility) obstacles to obtaining it? Does it already exist, or will you need to create it? Will you need to change its form in any way?_

 - Tech & tools: _What tool(s) will you use? Will you need training or guidance to use it (them)? Can you use them on your computer, or will you need to acquire or use other equipment (for instance, a video recorder from the Charles Library)? Do you have a plan if you run into technical problems? Do you have a backup tool in mind, in case the one you wish to use doesnâ€™t work out for any reason?_

We need to expand this list to include any Indigineous, Asian, Latino or other POC owners. This list needs to be organized into a Google sheet by name of brewery/distillery/winery, location (city, state), BIPOC category. We also want to document their websites and other accompanying information like advertisements, branding, and market strategy.

### Part III: The outcome: **To be completed by 5pm October 10, 2022**

_Each group will analyze their problem and evidence with the identified methods in order to convey an argument, and they will define parameters and a loose timeline for the project outcome._

PROBLEM: Our goal is to create a network of Breweries, Wineries, and Distilleries around he continental United States owned by a variety of marginalized groups. We plan to chart them on a map, and establish a database of characteristics like establishment date, location, and market/brand strategy. 

**EVIDENCE:**  

We have collected a list of sources that we will combine into an aggregate map. We will combine all of these source into one document and then remove any duplicates to ensure we have a broad collection of businesses.

Source #2: Distillery Trail
Source #3: One Pint at a Time: Documenting the Black Experience in American Craft Beer
Source #4: Black-owned wine and spirits makers you should know about
Source # 5: List of Black owned distilleries

**METHODS:** 

Our first step is to organize the breweries, distilleries, and wineries in an excel sheet with columns for city and state, ethnicities/race, gender, and whether it is a brewery, distillery , or winery. We will also have a column for an image (to be inserted into the map during the mapping step) as well as a column for a brief description, which will also be added into the map during the mapping phase. 

We will have 3 separate tabs - 1 for breweries, 1 for distilleries, and 1 for wineries. 

Once we have the information organized, we will split up the 3 tabs evenly and begin mapping the b/w/d using StoryMapJS.

If possible, complimenting the mapping component of the project will be a couple of data visualizations. One may chart the number of breweries, distilleries, and wineries by geographic region and be presented in graph format, while another may reflect the growth of these establishments in the United States over a set number of years (sample question: how many BIPOC-owned businesses of this kind were founded between 1990-present?).


**PARAMETERS:**

Establish a time frame
For the component of the project that involves comparison of visual advertising and marketing strategies, create a small number of broad categories in which to group similar data
Limit map captions to 250-300 words maximum

**TIMELINE:** 

October 24, 2022 - preliminary list of businesses and a working bibliography of relevant sources compiled

November 4, 2022 - check-in with Dr. Heider to raise any questions or concerns, as well as receive feedback 

November 14, 2022 - first iteration of maps and visualizations complete. If undecided, make decisions about whether or not the project requires a website/the most effective platform for its exhibition
November 28, 2022 - begin finalizing the project in preparation for presentation the following week

December 2, 2022 - meet to discuss presentation strategies and make sure all are happy with the the project as it stands

December 5, 2022 - present project in class (10-15 minutes with Q&A to follow) and submit reflection (Ryan is responsible for the latter action item)
